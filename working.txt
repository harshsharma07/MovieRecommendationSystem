2. WORKING
The movie recommendation system basically works by
providing suggestions to the users by using the two
renowned algorithms explained above. This movie
recommendation system recommends movies to a user or
client by evaluating IMDB ratings. The software and
language which we have used for designing our interface and
front end is Visual Basic Asp.Net. For creating database, we
have used SQL Server since it is convenient.
This system collaborates with IMDB ratings and displays a
list of movies which are highly rated by a user based on
category of the movie. This approach asks the user to
provide 2 inputs –
1. Category of the movie (for e.g. comedy)
2. Year in which the movie is released (for e.g. 2016)
The algorithm segregates the list of movies from the dataset
according to the inputs provided by user and finally displays
the list of movies. The algorithm compares the inputs with
the traits of the dataset and formulates the list. A user may
select more than one category according to his fancies. A
bright feature of allowing the user to rate movies has
enhanced the beauty of this recommender system. This is
achieved by using collaborative filtering approach, wherein
the system will provide recommendations to other likeminded users which have the same taste.
Example-User XYZ watches Movie “Bajirao Mastani” of
category “Romance” (1 movie may fall in more than one
category) and rates 8.5/10 (8.5 is considered to be a good
rating). A like-minded person which has the same taste and
is searching for the same category, then he may receive
“Bajirao Mastani” as one of the suggestions. The only
problem in this prototype is that a user can’t upload/view
movies online on this website
