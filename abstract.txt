Abstract - Now-a-days recommender systems areused in our
day to day life. Yet, they are far from perfection. In this project,
we will try to understand the various types of recommendation
systems also comparing their output with other smaller
datasets. We will be trying to develop a scalable model to
perform statistics. We commence by developing and
comparing the different kinds of prototypes on a smaller
dataset of 1000 ratings. Then, we try to gauge the system so
that it is able to handle 200 ratings by using MS SQL server.
We come to know that for a concise dataset, implementing
user-based collaborative filtering results with better and
efficient outputs.
